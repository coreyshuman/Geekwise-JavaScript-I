# JavaScript I - Geekwise Academy

JavaScript I (JSI) is a fast-paced, 36 hour course offered by Geekwise Academy out of Fresno, CA. This class begins at the very bottom by establishing basic programming ideas, syntax, and practices. By the end of our 12 3-hour sessions together, students will be able to design rich, functional web applications using the full capabilities of JavaScript to power their projects

Each folder (Day 1 - Day 12) contains a lesson plan document and aditional files for that class session.
The folder 'html' contains html versions of the lesson plans which can be viewed via github.io
